Some of the expected fields are:</p> <ul> <li><code>title</code>: Short title which will appear in the nav menu, and in the tags page as hyperlink to the page. For example <code>Author-Year</code>. If this field is absent, the default title will be the first header in the document.</li> <li><code>fulltitle</code>: Full title of the paper/book. It will appear at the header of the page, and in the tags page (shortened). If this field is absent, the value of the field <code>title</code> will be used instead. If the <code>field</code> title is also absent, the html version of the page won't show any metadata (including any of the following).</li> <li><code>author</code>: A YAML list whose elements are the authors. It will appear under the title in the document page.</li> <li><code>year</code>: Year of the publication. It will appear under the author list in the document page.</li> <li><code>tags</code>: A YAML list of tags. They will appear before the page contents, in the document page, and they are used to automatically generate the \"Tags\" page. If this meadata field is absent for some documents, those will not appear in the \"Tags\" page.</li> <li><code>url</code>: URL to the paper/book, if available online. When this field is present, the page will show a link icon after the full title, which will be an hyperlink to this url.</li> <li><code>date</code>: Date in which the <code>.md</code> file was written. Currently not used, but planned for creating a \"blog\" page which lists the entries in chronological order, perhaps grouped by months.</li> </ul> <p>The author can include any other metadata field in the YAML section. Any unknow field will not be visible in the document page, but they can be used from plugins for classification, or shown if the theme is modified to include them.</p> <p>After the YAML metadata, the document begins. It is expected that headers start at level 1 (single <code>#</code>). Mkdocs options will transform them to level 2, in order to generate the appropirate TOC per document (shown to the right)</p> YAML section example <pre><code>---\ntitle: AuthorName2019\nfulltitle: The long title of the paper and such and that\nauthor: \n- A.
